Description: |
    Doxygen is a documentation system for C, C++, Java, and IDL. It can
    generate an online class browser (in HTML) and an offline reference
    manual (in LaTeX) from a set of documented source files. The
    documentation is extracted directly from the sources. Doxygen is
    developed on a Linux platform, but it runs on most other UNIX flavors
    as well. An executable for Windows 95/NT is also available.
